Major:
- Organise reconnection into IRC - do we want Client to die on disconnect?
- Implement quitting cleanly!

Possibles:
- (Possibly) Organise and group all greenlet instances (so we can KILL THEM ALL)
- Refactor receiving targeted commands to their targets
- Allow for multiple clients per server - each plugin its own client?
- Refactor Config, so that it's arranged by servers and clients;
  clients choose what servers and rooms they'd like to join
- Organise Channels and Users so that they always represent the same instance
- Make things more asynchronistic, because well then at least I could argue
  for still using gevent over try/accept

Ideas:
- Implement cross-server communication (between clients? between bot?)
- Decide whether bot should be cross-server, or per-server
