Major:
- Organise reconnection into IRC - do we want Client to die on disconnect?
- Implement quitting cleanly!

Possibles:
- (Possibly) Organise and group all greenlet instances (so we can KILL THEM ALL)
- Refactor receiving targeted commands to their targets
- Organise Channels and Users so that they always represent the same instance
- Make things more asynchronistic, because well then at least I could argue
  for still using gevent over try/accept

Ideas:
- Implement cross-server communication (between clients? between bot?)

Goals:
- Show sailor moon ascii art
- Ban users at random
- FAQ service
- Provide news
- Moderation
